A quick project my partner [Richard](https://github.com/rscastro) and I built at Hack Reactor to visualize large amounts of data from data.gov using D3.js. I am very interested in social statistics such as the one for this.

Dependencies include: jQuery, underscore.js and d3.js which are all packaged in lib folder.
